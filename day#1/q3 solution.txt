Since we have two eggs, we can skip multiple floors at a time until the first egg breaks, keeping track of which floors we dropped it from.
Once that egg breaks we can use the second egg to try every floor, 
starting on the last floor where the egg didn't break and ending on the floor below the one where it did break.

We want to skip as few floors as possible, so if the first egg breaks right away we don't have a lot of floors to drop our second egg from.
We always want to be able to reduce the number of floors we're skipping

variable that iam using are : 'ad','pre','i','skip',
keeping the variable 'ad' for counting the no of drop
'pre' is for last floor where the egg didn't break
'i' is floor we will drop the egg and we increment value by 'skip'
